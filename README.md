# Detection-of-Hate-and-Offensive-Speech-in-Dravidian-Languages-Code-Mix-Text-using-Transformers

Classifying hate speech in low-resource languages like Kannada, Tamil, and Malayalam is challenging due to noisy, unbalanced, and multilingual datasets. This work introduces a robust pipeline using the IndicBERTv2 transformer to address this. This approach integrates a custom classification head with multiple pooling strategies and employs strong data augmenta
tion, including back translation and paraphrasing, to enhance generalization. This paper tackles class imbalance with focalloss and weighted sampling, while training is optimized through progressive, language-specific fine-tuning and ensembling.
